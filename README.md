## Objective
Build a simple application using React and the Blockchain API that loads and displays the balance and transactions for a bitcoin address someone searches and updates on incoming transactions.

## If I had more time..
- Improve form validation for search address
- Move websocket implementation to the server side
- Each transaction item could display more useful information
- Improve on styling and user experience
- Implement unit and e2e tests
